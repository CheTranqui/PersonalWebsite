                Moxie: Martian Magic
            </h1>
            <p class="martianStory">
                This morning marks a milestone in the Martian memoirs. Moxie, the magic Martian machine makes mini mistrals, managing to maximise 02 from the mainly CO2 medium of Mars. Magnificent.

                Note: a MOXIE is a real machine. They put a small prototype on the current rover to do some real world testing.

                After the opening of our new open-air gym in MTOlympicBidGymDome, MTSponsor applied to host the Olympics on Mars, saying, \"We have the best view of Mount Olympus and a Gym, what more could one ask for?\" The International Olympics Committee on Earth rejected the proposal, saying \"Wait, that was an actual bid? You don't even have a pool.\" MTSponsor responded by saying they will start their own Interstellar Olympics.  Expect track, blackjack, marbles, and Drone Jumping to headline the experience."

Games of Hoopers will start things off this coming Saturday in the open air gym. Also considered for the Martian Games are Dome Skiing, where contestants race down the outside of a dome on pallets, and Drone Jumping."

                On July 4th in 1997 NASA set down the very first actual rover on the Red Planet.  Shortly after the Mars Pathfinder landed, Sojourner, a solar-powered rover, rolled out and began to scan the surface.  Expected to last just 7 sol, it was finally called to a stop after 91 sol having traveled a total of just over 100 meters and sent a myriad of photos back to Earth for study.

                With a height of nearly 25km, Olympus Mons is approximately 2.5 times as tall as its less impressive Earthen counterpart, Mount Everest. At this time of the year, as the sun drops below the peak of Olympus Mons, its shadow covers much of the surface and night comes early. Olympus Mons is located at 18N, 133W.

Found at 13S, 65W, this enormous canyon measures nearly 4000km long and reaches a depth of 7km at one point. This is yet another long standing record that now officially belongs to Mars.

            <p class="martianStory">
                Despite the success of our budding colonization of Mars, NASA continued its diligent work towards the Mars 2020 mission. Launching from Cape Canaveral in the late summer of 2020 the new rover incorporated, a spectrometer, radar equipment, drilling and storage, and several other advanced imaging devices, along with a new test unit, the \"MOXIE\", a 300 watt device that they were testing to generate on the Red Planet for the very first time..

                This story was actually referencing the rover that just landed! The Moxie is only 150 watts, tho. I added the second period at the end to make it feel ironic to the player who was already ON Mars. :-D

                The 1999 Mars Polar Lander was the only rover that was sent with a microphone equipped. Due to the crash landing that December, we've been unable to gather data from it. Despite this, simulations have been made with the requisite 1% of Earth's pressurization. The recordings are surprisingly easy to pick up by the human ear, if sounding a bit quieter than expected.

                How Mars Got Its Name
            </h1>
            <p class="martianStory">
                The Romans left an indelible impact upon Earthen history, such a great impact that they even determined the name of various elements of our solar system. Even without telescopes they identified each of the brightest five planets, alongside the Moon and the Sun, of course. Each of these planets was then named after gods, the most important of which was the god of war, Mars, who rode into battle on a chariot pulled by the horses Phobos and Deimos (meaning ‘fear’ and ‘panic’). May the foreboding names of our new planet and moons not be indicative of our imminent future.

                In an unexpected turn of events, MTSexyColonistName has officially produced the first ever Martian adult film.  Starring 11 different colonists with MTSexyColonistName as the lead, it has become quite a hit on earth.  The film also provides a sneak peek into Martian pipe work and our stockpiles of electronics and machine parts in the background.  MTSponsor has declared themselves not responsible for the social implications of such actions, but did praise the artistic vision of the Director calling it a \"unique and innovative production\".

                Vegan Declares Mars Meat-Free Planet

                MTVegan1Name has stepped up to make their presence known today as they've declared Mars to be Vegan Atlantis.  With Earth now lost forever to the carnivores, Mars is as yet unmarred by the carnivorous and MTVegan1Name has vowed to do everything in their power to keep it that way.  Doesn't sound good for all the bacon lovers out there as MTVegan1MedicName has stepped up to back the proposition as well.  We'll have to wait and see if it sticks.

                MTVegan2Name's ambitions have lead to the creation of a new foundation called the Vegan Martian Coalition. Their proposition of a meat-free Mars seems to be gaining momentum as 10 sol have now passed since the initial proposition and neither cattle nor hog has yet seen import.  Recognizing that opposition has been light, the MTLeaderTitle and MTSponsor have each agreed to sit down to discuss the issue more in depth.

                Martian Aurora Unique In Origin

                The aurora that we see here on mars on such a regular basis turns out to be a bit unusual. While Earthling aurorae are due to an excess of electrons bombarding the planet, our own is a result of a proton shower sent off by the Sun's own solar winds which Earth mostly avoids due to its much more powerful magnetic field.

                MTSponsor's recent announcement that cursory scans of the Martian surface are complete has prompted an interesting response from the public.  The Flat Mars League (FML) has come forward to declare that the scans provide full evidence, beyond any doubt, that Mars is indeed flat.  Their spokesman, MTIdiotName, has pointed to the clear squareness of the resulting map, and the fact that the horizon is so obviously flat as well.  When asked about Earth, MTIdiotName stated that, \"Unlike Mars, Earth has been observed to be round\".

The responsibilities are vast in leading such an intrepid endeavor as ours here on Mars.  Let's hope and pray (hard) that MTLeader is up to the challenge.
