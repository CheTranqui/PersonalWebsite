                                    released a game called Surviving Mars. I wanted the colonists to have a more personal feel, so I trusted that I learned enough in making the drafting minigame and made my first ever mod: The Martian Tribune. It presents stories that my team and I wrote to the player every three in-game days and each story was seleted dynamically based upon the current state of the game.

                                    As Project Lead I recruited a second author and later brought a professional programmer on board to refactor my original code (what is currently on GitHub is her refactoring). This was an awesome experience in just how challenging, rewarding, and diverse the development experience is when seeing a project through from start to finish.

                In Spring of 2019 my uncle passed away. To assist my father with his estate work I built him a simple website that he could run locally to track his tasks, contacts, goods, and properties. This work forced me to put into practice what I had learned from my informal study via

                This was my first real experience with DOM manipulation. It uses LocalStorage for persistence and it was exciting to be able to use data from one form ('Contacts') to populate the dropdown of another ('Buyer' field in 'Properties'). It was also interesting to work with my dad for the project. The Print page was a result of him asking how he can access the information while working at the farm, for instance.
