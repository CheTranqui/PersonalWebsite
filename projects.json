      "projectDescription": "My current side-project is creating my own personalized sudoku. It was very challenging to create a worthwhile algorithm for board generation, but with that now in place I'm currently working on adding and debugging features to make it an ideal experience.'",
      "projectLesson": "A great approach a new project is to first create a working MVP, then refine it. The original algorithm randomly placed numbers from the first square's top row into the second's middle or bottom and continued as such with placing specific numbers in particular locations randomly. It was bulky and no more accurate than this final version. I found this version when I got to square number 5 and had to take all directions of collisions into account. Extrapolating that provided this nicely succint result.",

      "projectDescription": "In 2018 <a class='inlineLink' href='https://www.haemimontgames.com/' target='_blank'>Haemimont Games</a> released a game called Surviving Mars. I wanted the colonists to have a more personal feel, so I trusted that I'd learned enough in making the drafting minigame and made my first ever mod: The Martian Tribune. It presents stories that my team and I wrote to the player every three in-game days. Stories are selected dynamically based upon the current state of the game.",
      "projectLesson": "As Project Lead I recruited a second author and later brought on a professional programmer to refactor my original LUA code (what is currently on GitHub is her refactoring). This was an awesome experience in just how challenging, rewarding, and diverse the development experience is when seeing a project through from start to finish.",

      "projectDescription": "In Spring of 2020 my uncle passed away. To assist my father with his estate work I built him a simple website that he could run locally to track his tasks, contacts, goods, and properties. This work forced me to put into practice what I had learned from my informal study via <a class='inlineLink' href='https://www.freecodecamp.org' target='_blank'>freeCodeCamp.org</a> and <a class='inlineLink' href='https://github.com/webdevandres' target='_blank'>a friend's</a> informal mentorship.",
      "projectLesson": "This was my first real experience with DOM manipulation. It uses LocalStorage for persistence and it was exciting to be able to use data from one form ('Contacts') to populate the dropdown of another. It was also interesting to work with my dad as my client for the project. The Print page was a result of him asking how he can access the information while working at the farm or with the Realtor.",

This page is the final project associated with my initial introduction to JavaScript at the time.",
      "projectLesson": "I found that I have an aptitude for programming, am able to readily grasp the concepts presented, and that despite the occasional challenge that may stump me initially, I have the patience and determination to push through and still find the learning experience and problem solving enjoyable. It is because of this experience that I decided to pursue a degree and new career in Software Development.",
